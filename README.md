## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Accessibility workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

I have deepened the use of **SASS** focusing on splitting into modules and reusing code through `mixins` and variables. I got more familiar with the **Mobile-first** approach and with the **Grid** css.

I added **Login and Sign Up** modals and initially had problems with centering because using `flex` the modal was centered in the center of the whole page and not in the center of the visible screen, but then I fixed it using `display: fixed` combined with old style alignment preceding *flex and grid*.  

### Continued development

In adding modals, however, I was unable to remove that tremendous positioning effect you notice when modals are opened and centered on the screen. Open to feedback on how to fix it :)
